Create a simple script containing a single function. 
This function should display a message to clearly indicate it was generated when the function was run.
 Then, display another message outside the function clearly indicating it was generated outside of it.
===
#1  /bin/bash

hello()
{
  echo "Hello this message is inside the function"
}
hello
echo "Hello this message is outside the function"
