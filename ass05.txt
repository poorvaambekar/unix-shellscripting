Write a script that runs three commands:
Evaluate an arithmetic expression
Attempt to remove a file that does not exist in the current directory
Evaluate another arithmetic expression
Immediately after each command, echo the exit status of that command to the terminal using the appropriate variable to show success 
and failure exit codes.
===
echo "Enter a number"
read a
echo "Enter another number"
read b

echo "Addittion is :\c"
c= echo `expr $a + $b`
echo "Substraction is :\c"
d= echo `expr $a - $b`
echo "Multiplication is :\c"
e= echo `expr $a \* $b`
echo "Division  is :\c"
f= echo `expr $a / $b`
echo "Modular division  is :\c"
g= echo `expr $a % $b`

echo "exit status"
echo $?

#to remove a file 

echo "\n \n Enter a file name to be removed :\c"
read filename
-f $filename
rm -i $filename
