Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. 
Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable.
 Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value).
 If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

a=4
echo "Enter a number between 1 to 5:\c"
read num
if [ $num = $a ]
then 
         echo "correct"
    else 
         echo "wrong"
