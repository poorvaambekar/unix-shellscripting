Create a script that prompts the user for a number.
 That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). 
The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

===
echo "Enter the number for how many time message display:\c"
read my_num
count=1
while [ $count -le $my_num ]
do
     echo "have a good day"
     count=`expr $count + 1`
done
