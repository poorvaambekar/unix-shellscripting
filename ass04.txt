Create a simple script that does the following:
Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null
Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.
===
echo "hello"
echo "what's up" > /dev/null
echo "hi"
echo "using" > /dev/null
